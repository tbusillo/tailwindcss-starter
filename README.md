- 

## Getting started

1. Use your system's terminal/shell to clone this repository.

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:tbusillo/tailwind_starter.git
  ```

2. Git will clone the repository into a new folder and you will need to change to the directory (e.g., `cd tailwindcss-starter`)

3. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as well as a package manager (note: Node.js comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) out of the box, but you're welcome to use yarn, pnpm, etc., as well)
4. Install the project's dependencies.

  ```bash
  # npm
  npm install

  # yarn
  yarn install

  # pnpm
  pnpm install
  ```

5. Start the Tailwind watch process using the `watch` command (e.g., `npm run watch`, `yarn watch`, `pnpm watch`, etc.)

6. If things worked, you should now see something like the below in your terminal. You will need to leave the terminal open and running its watch process so Tailwind can detect changes to your HTML/CSS and generate the necessary styles.

```bash
Rebuilding...
Done in 90ms.
```

7. Open the `index.html` file in the `src` directory in a web browser and you should see an initial "Hello world!". 
- note: depending on your OS/browser, you may need to use something like [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to open HTML files on your local filesystem.

8. Make changes to the `index.html` file and you will see the watch process rebuild your project in the terminal and the changes should be reflected in your web browser. You will also see the CSS generated by Tailwind in `dist/output.css`

Congratulations! You are now one more step along on your journey to learn Tailwind and I wish you the best of luck!
